# bodywork

A framework for deploying statistical (machine) learning models on Kubernetes.

## Documentation

Bodywork documentation is written with the help of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). To build and serve the documentation contained within the `docs` folder, run

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

From within an active virtual environment that has had `requirements_dev.txt` installed. You will then be able to browse the docs at `http://localhost:8000`.
